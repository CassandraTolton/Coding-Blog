*Setting up Github Journal and updating Portfolio*

<hr>

Unfortunatly I had a migraine, so i was not able to update my portfolio. However i did finish setting up the GitHub journal and have set an alarm everyday to remind me to update the journal with my progress. Note: the goals for the end of the year will be benchedmarked at the end of the year (1 month or so) and will add a section called what i learned that will be easy for others to see the skills i picked up for each project/course that i complete.

i also downloaded Visual Studio 2022 and will begin to familiarize myself with it. I also need to start reading the changes that were made with the new .NET 6.0 release and make sure that i am up to date with all the changes that are being made. i came up with project ideas and added them to the check list, one will show case a simple front end desktop application. this project is meant for showing that i know how to use pure C# to design something that i can use and benefit from. The second project is a recreation of my first big backend C# hotel booking application, except this will have a both front and backend side, with the ability to allow users to use and check to see what roomnumber they and what kind of room they have with which commedaties. And there will be a management/hotel side that can change bookings, rooms, update customer information and will invoice room prices. this project is not designed to be a third party booking serivce, it is intended for the hotel use.
