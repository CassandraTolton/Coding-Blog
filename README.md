*Setting up Github Journal and updating Portfolio*

<hr>

Unfortunately, I had a migraine, so I was not able to update my portfolio. However, I did finish setting up the GitHub journal and have created an alarm to remind me to update the journal with my progress. Note: the goals for the end of the year will be benchmarked at the end of the year (1 month or so) and will add a section called "What I Learned" that will make it easy for others to see the skills I have picked up for each project/course that I complete.


I also downloaded Visual Studio 2022 and will begin to familiarize myself with it. I will need to start reading the changes that involve the .NET 6.0 release and all the changes that came with it. I came up with project ideas and added them to the checklist. The first project, a journal that will help keep track of my daily progress and possibly update GitHub, will showcase a simple front-end desktop application. This project will showcase that I know how to use pure C# to design something beneficial. The second project is a recreation of my backend C# hotel booking application. Except this project will have the ability to allow users to use and check to see their room number and what type of room with which commodities they have. Management/hotel personnel will have access to change bookings, rooms, update customer information, and create invoices. This project is not a third-party booking service: it is software designed for hotels and their customers.

*Meetings and working on TestLabs and python*

<hr>

Finished labs for testout, so i will begin to study more so i can get my A+ certification to boost my resume and will also work on python course to hopefully get it done by the end of the month. i will also need to start planning things out for the month of december as i am going out of town for the last week of it. i will continue to update the journal and code however due to limited internet access i feel it will be difficult to update to Github but we will see.

i am also looking into joining a coding discord

*python*

<hr>

Finding it hard to update the journal daily, with the semester almost done theres a lot of work to be done. Hopefully when break comes i can focus more on programming. I might end up deleting all of this as this was not the intention of the journel. it was more suppose to be about my progress however progress has be slow.

*adding comments into hotel booking application and creating more mock ups for the upcoming projects.*

<hr>

I added comments to the hotel booking application (back end) Note: this is different then the upcoming project as the newer project will be a full stack application. the mock ups need color and more testing before i start hard coding everything, i also need to figure out functionality and where everything will be. im still stuck on two items, the clock in feature and the statistics feature.
