*Setting up Github Journal and updating Portfolio*

<hr>

Unfortunately, I had a migraine, so I was not able to update my portfolio. However, I did finish setting up the GitHub journal and have created an alarm to remind me to update the journal with my progress. Note: the goals for the end of the year will be benchmarked at the end of the year (1 month or so) and will add a section called "What I Learned" that will make it easy for others to see the skills I have picked up for each project/course that I complete.


I also downloaded Visual Studio 2022 and will begin to familiarize myself with it. I will need to start reading the changes that involve the .NET 6.0 release and all the changes that came with it. I came up with project ideas and added them to the checklist. The first project, a journal that will help keep track of my daily progress and possibly update GitHub, will showcase a simple front-end desktop application. This project will showcase that I know how to use pure C# to design something beneficial. The second project is a recreation of my backend C# hotel booking application. Except this project will have the ability to allow users to use and check to see their room number and what type of room with which commodities they have. Management/hotel personnel will have access to change bookings, rooms, update customer information, and create invoices. This project is not a third-party booking service: it is software designed for hotels and their customers.
