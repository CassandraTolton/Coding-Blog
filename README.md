*Setting up Github Journal and updating Portfolio*

<hr>

Unfortunately, I had a migraine, so I was not able to update my portfolio. However, I did finish setting up the GitHub journal and have created an alarm to remind me to update the journal with my progress. Note: the goals for the end of the year will be benchmarked at the end of the year (1 month or so) and will add a section called "What I Learned" that will make it easy for others to see the skills I have picked up for each project/course that I complete.


I also downloaded Visual Studio 2022 and will begin to familiarize myself with it. I will need to start reading the changes that involve the .NET 6.0 release and all the changes that came with it. I came up with project ideas and added them to the checklist. The first project, a journal that will help keep track of my daily progress and possibly update GitHub, will showcase a simple front-end desktop application. This project will showcase that I know how to use pure C# to design something beneficial. The second project is a recreation of my backend C# hotel booking application. Except this project will have the ability to allow users to use and check to see their room number and what type of room with which commodities they have. Management/hotel personnel will have access to change bookings, rooms, update customer information, and create invoices. This project is not a third-party booking service: it is software designed for hotels and their customers.

*Creating wireframes for projects and working on python course*
Created wireframes for the upcoming project along with working on the python course and completely a section. one more section then ill be done with unit 2, I will try to work on projects but i am still trying to experiment with .NET 6 WPF wireframe and form. it is very different compared to Windows forms, and im still getting used to the new UI.

*Meetings and working on TestLabs and python*
Finished labs for testout, so i will begin to study more so i can get my A+ certification to boost my resume and will also work on python course to hopefully get it done by the end of the month. i will also need to start planning things out for the month of december as i am going out of town for the last week of it. i will continue to update the journal and code however due to limited internet access i feel it will be difficult to update to Github but we will see.

i am also looking into joining a coding discord
